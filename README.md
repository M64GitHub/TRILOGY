# TRILOGY
A complete game with sound- and animation-effects written in assembly on and for the HP49 calculator (5bit processor!)

### The Game
This is a logic game, consisting of many levels. Levels can be bigger than the actual screen. The levels consist of a field with different types of stones placed onto it.  

There are regular stones, and special stones that can move. **Moving** stones will stop on any other stone (or the border) in their way. They show their moving direction as an arrow.  

**Rotation** stones will defer the way a moving stone moves. When a moving stone hits a rotation stone, it's direction changes.

Often, moving stones are blocked by regular stones on start. Once you make regular stones disappear, they start moving and can complicate / change the logic you had in your mind ;)

### The Rules
Select any 3 same stones located in the shape of a **rectangular triangle** to make them disappear.  

When all regular stones have disappeared, the level is solved.
